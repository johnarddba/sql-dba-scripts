Here’s my proposed schedule from December 2025 to January 2026. I will be travelling to USA from December 6 (Saturday) night until January 14 (Wednesday).
Critical days will be on December 28 and 29 as we are both OFF. I will try to get online those days but still depends on what will be my situation there. Let me know if this will work for you or if you have any suggestion. 


Here’s our planned schedule in December 2025 to January 2026. Johnard and I agreed to this schedule. We’ll just communicate in advance if there will be any changes or any adjustment. 
Meanwhile, I will be travelling to USA on 6th of December (nighttime) until 14th of January. I will send a separate email for this to get approval from you and Isa as part of the requirement from HR. 


Hey guys, good morning/afternoon… kind reminder that we need to monitor the failover alerts closely in order to avoid any instances running on the secondary… today will prepare scripts to check if all DBs are on their primary and probably alerts if not … let me know if you have any questions


Johnard, Madel please check the DBs and AGs- I checked them, but it would be better to have a second set of eyes
 
Primary nodes should be:
 

 
just a basic check- if AGs are running primaries on the correct nodes and secondaries are synchronized 
 
thank you
 



 During our meeting on 9th December, I discussed with you the fact that you left an hour and half before the end of your shift on 8th December without ensuring there was another team member online. I also pointed out the inconsistencies I have observed in your start and finish times compared to your assigned shift schedule. For example, on 18th December I logged in to check if we had an available person online and I noted that you were away for 34 minutes after already taking your lunch break, without notifying a member of management. I expect to see an immediate improvement in your availability during working hours and I will continue to monitor this. 

Based on the concerns outlined above as well as the concerns I discussed with you recently in relation to your performance in your role, you will be required to work from the office from Tuesday, 3rd February.

Please confirm your understanding and acknowledgment of the above.







Dear [Manager’s Name],

Thank you for your message and for outlining your concerns. I would like to provide clarification regarding my work schedule and the specific dates mentioned.

For the past several years, the schedule we have consistently followed has been 6:00 AM to 3:00 PM Philippine Time. This schedule has remained unchanged regardless of when Daylight Saving Time started or ended, and there was no announcement or communication regarding any schedule adjustment. Based on this, 6:00 AM–3:00 PM PH time is the schedule I have continued to follow.

To address the specific instances mentioned:

December 8 – I acknowledge that I clocked in 26 minutes late. However, I ensured that I still completed my full 9-hour work schedule by logging off at 3:26 PM. I have attached a screenshot for your reference.

December 18 – I took my break at 1:56 PM and returned at 2:29 PM. I may have appeared idle for a few minutes afterward as I was not feeling well that day. However, I did not complete a full one-hour lunch break. I have attached a screenshot for your reference.

Following our recent one-on-one discussion, instances of tardiness have occurred only twice, each for 3–4 minutes, which happened because I had already begun checking emails and work-related items but unintentionally forgot to clock in on time.

I fully understand the concerns raised and appreciate the feedback. I would also like to respectfully request consideration regarding the requirement to work onsite. Morning traffic conditions in the Philippines are extremely challenging, and my travel time from home to the office typically takes 2–3 hours, depending on traffic. This would significantly affect my ability to consistently meet the early start time.

I am committed to maintaining consistent availability during my assigned working hours and to improving communication moving forward. I value my role and appreciate your time and consideration of the context provided.

Please let me know if any further clarification is needed.



It has come to my attention that Madel advised you on 12th December that she filed a vacation day on 20th December. You were scheduled to take a rest day on 20th December.

As you are aware, if either you or Madel are on leave on a given day, you are required to provide cover for each other to ensure there is adequate team coverage. Madel advised that she informed you that she would be on leave on 20th December. However, you did not report for work that day. Can you please explain the reason you did not report for work on 20th December and failed to notify myself or another member of management.



Thank you for the opportunity to clarify the circumstances regarding 20 December.

On 12 December, Madel informed me that she had submitted a PTO request for that date. However, I did not receive any update or official confirmation that her leave had been approved. Without such confirmation, and as I was already scheduled for a rest day, I followed our regular schedule and took the day off. This also allowed me to attend a pre-arranged medical appointment.

At the time, my understanding was that coverage arrangements were managed, as no official notification indicated otherwise. I hope this provides clarity, and I am happy to provide any additional details if required.

Yours sincerely,
Johnard Hidalgo
