Here’s my proposed schedule from December 2025 to January 2026. I will be travelling to USA from December 6 (Saturday) night until January 14 (Wednesday).
Critical days will be on December 28 and 29 as we are both OFF. I will try to get online those days but still depends on what will be my situation there. Let me know if this will work for you or if you have any suggestion. 


Here’s our planned schedule in December 2025 to January 2026. Johnard and I agreed to this schedule. We’ll just communicate in advance if there will be any changes or any adjustment. 
Meanwhile, I will be travelling to USA on 6th of December (nighttime) until 14th of January. I will send a separate email for this to get approval from you and Isa as part of the requirement from HR. 


Hey guys, good morning/afternoon… kind reminder that we need to monitor the failover alerts closely in order to avoid any instances running on the secondary… today will prepare scripts to check if all DBs are on their primary and probably alerts if not … let me know if you have any questions


Johnard, Madel please check the DBs and AGs- I checked them, but it would be better to have a second set of eyes
 
Primary nodes should be:
 

 
just a basic check- if AGs are running primaries on the correct nodes and secondaries are synchronized 
 
thank you
 



 During our meeting on 9th December, I discussed with you the fact that you left an hour and half before the end of your shift on 8th December without ensuring there was another team member online. I also pointed out the inconsistencies I have observed in your start and finish times compared to your assigned shift schedule. For example, on 18th December I logged in to check if we had an available person online and I noted that you were away for 34 minutes after already taking your lunch break, without notifying a member of management. I expect to see an immediate improvement in your availability during working hours and I will continue to monitor this. 

Based on the concerns outlined above as well as the concerns I discussed with you recently in relation to your performance in your role, you will be required to work from the office from Tuesday, 3rd February.

Please confirm your understanding and acknowledgment of the above.
