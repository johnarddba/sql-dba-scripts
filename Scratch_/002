Hello, 

I hope you are well.

In order to help me better understand the tasks that are being completed each day and to ensure the effective oversight of the completion of tasks and tickets within the team, I would like you to send me a daily report/file of all tasks, tickets or other items that you completed during your shift. If you can send this to me at the end of your shift each day starting on Monday, 19th January. In this report, you can include any support or trainings that you required in order to resolve each task or ticket, where applicable. This will allow me to identify the areas where you need additional support or that you are finding more challenging.

If the completion of any task is delayed or you have not completed for some reason, please provide an explanation in the file of the reason for the delay or non-completion. I have attached a template that you can use – please add the date to the name of the file when you are sending the report each day, e.g. Daily Report – 1 Feb 2025.

Please confirm your understanding and acknowledgement of the above and let me know if you have any questions.
