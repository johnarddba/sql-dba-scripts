Hello,

Can you please let us know if you acknowledged the below notifications reg. ENGG DR (between 21:15 and 2 AM we received 7 alerts reg. the DR Latency). 

ENGG DR is considered P1 severity and should be treated as top priority.



BAU issues are with higher priority compared to engineering tasks. Please note that this task should have been completed long ago so I cannot accept this explanation.
